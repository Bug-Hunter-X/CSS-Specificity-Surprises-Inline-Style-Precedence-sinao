The solution involves a better understanding and application of CSS specificity.  To address the specificity issues in the original code, restructure the CSS to ensure that intended styles are applied.  Avoid unnecessary inline styles unless absolutely necessary, as they often lead to maintenance issues.

Here's an improved version that uses more specific selectors and avoids conflicting styles:

```css
div {
  font-size: 16px;
}

p {
  font-size: 18px;
}

/* Instead of using div p, be more specific */
#myDiv p {
  font-size: 14px;
}

/*Avoid inline styles if possible. If absolutely necessary, use !important cautiously*/
```

By using more specific selectors and avoiding inline styles whenever possible, the intended style will be applied consistently and predictably.
